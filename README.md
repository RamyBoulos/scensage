# SceneSage ðŸŽ¬

**SceneSage** is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to automate scene analysis from `.srt` subtitle files using large language models (LLMs). It parses subtitle files, segments scenes based on customizable strategies, and generates detailed, structured annotations for each sceneâ€”such as summaries, character mentions, emotional tone, and cultural referencesâ€”via the Hugging Face Inference API.

## Features

- Parses `.srt` subtitle files with robust handling of common formats  
- Supports two scene segmentation strategies: LLM-based (`llm`) and time gap-based (`gap`)  
- Integrates with Hugging Face Inference API for LLM-powered scene annotation  
- Outputs structured JSON annotations including:  
  - Scene start and end timestamps  
  - Concatenated transcript text  
  - One-sentence summary  
  - Character mentions  
  - Mood/emotion analysis  
  - Up to three cultural references  
- CLI interface with options for model selection, scene limits, segmentation strategy, and output file specification  
- Designed for extensibility and ease of integration into media analysis pipelines

## Scene Segmentation Strategies

SceneSage supports flexible scene segmentation to adapt to different types of subtitle files and user needs:

- **LLM-based Segmentation (`llm`)** (default)  
  Scenes are segmented using a large language model that analyzes subtitle content to determine scene boundaries.

- **Time Gap Segmentation (`gap`)**  
  Scenes are segmented when there is a gap equal to or greater than a specified threshold (default: 4 seconds) between subtitle cues.

You can select the segmentation strategy with the `--strategy` flag and customize parameters such as the time gap threshold.

---

## Inference Modes

SceneSage supports different inference modes to balance speed and quality:

- **Streaming Mode**  
  Processes scenes sequentially and streams partial results for faster feedback.

- **Batch Mode**  
  Processes all scenes in a single batch request for efficiency.

Currently, streaming mode is the default and recommended for most use cases.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RamyBoulos/scenesage.git
cd scenesage

# (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Setup

### Hugging Face API Token

SceneSage requires a Hugging Face Inference API token to access language models:

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory with the following content:

   ```
   HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

2. Obtain your token from [Hugging Face Tokens Page](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

3. Ensure you have access to a text-generation capable model, such as `mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1`.

## Usage

### Basic Command

```bash
python scenesage.py your_subtitle_file.srt --output scenes.json
```

### Common Options

| Option           | Description                                               | Default                            |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `--model`        | Hugging Face model to use                                  | `mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1` |
| `--limit`        | Process only the first N scenes (for testing)             | Process all                      |
| `--strategy`     | Scene segmentation strategy: `llm` (default), `gap`       | `llm`                           |
| `--gap`          | Time gap threshold in seconds for `gap` segmentation      | `4` seconds                     |
| `--output`       | Output JSON file path                                      | `scenes.json`                   |

### Example

Process the first 10 scenes from `plan9.srt` using the default LLM-based segmentation:

```bash
python scenesage.py plan9.srt --limit 10 --output scenes.json
```

Use time gap segmentation with a 6-second gap threshold:

```bash
python scenesage.py plan9.srt --strategy gap --gap 6 --output scenes.json
```

Specify a different model:

```bash
python scenesage.py plan9.srt --model google/flan-t5-large --output scenes.json
```

---

## Makefile Shortcuts

If you prefer using `make`, the following shortcuts are available:

- **Run analysis on sample clip:**

  ```bash
  make run
  ```

- **Run analysis with first 10 scenes:**

  ```bash
  make run-limit
  ```

- **Clean output files:**

  ```bash
  make clean
  ```

## Output Examples

Below are sample outputs generated by SceneSage for a subtitle excerpt.

### Input Subtitle Excerpt (`clip.srt`):

```
1
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,759
Greetings, my friend. We are all interested in the future,

2
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,507
for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives.
```

### Corresponding JSON Output (`scenes.json`):

```json
[
  {
    "start": "00:00:22,719",
    "end": "00:00:31,507",
    "transcript": "Greetings, my friend. We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives.",
    "summary": "The narrator reflects on humanity's fascination with the future.",
    "characters": ["Narrator"],
    "mood": "thoughtful",
    "cultural_refs": []
  }
]
```

*Note:* Your actual output may vary depending on the model and parameters used.
